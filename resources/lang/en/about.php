The air pollution has been markedly increasing during these months. So we made a website to share and inform the public about the pollution in an effective way and also for the easy access of data for the people who want to analyze the air pollution.
    We take data from Purple Air\'s sensors in Yangon by using their API and conducted some calculations to convert PM2.5 values to AQI. We believe that this website will make people get awareness and avoid things that can pollute air as much as they can and also they could protect their beloved ones from the polluted air which can cause many severe health problems.',
